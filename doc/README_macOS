Install Godex filter on macOS
=============================

Compiling
~~~~~~~~~
For compile filter on macOS are needed a compiler, make utilities and header
files for CUPS and other used libraries.  All these components are in a Xcode
package, which is available via the Mac App Store free of charge.

Compiling and installation is described in README.


Installation printer in system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the filter, including PPDs, is installed correctly, then installation of Godex
printers is the same as others.


Printing
~~~~~~~~
For setting printer and media parameters you must display details in a print
menu and select "Printer Features".  There you can set a media type
(plain/labels; black mark; darkness), rotation, mirror, negative, print mode
(thermo/thermotransfer) and print speed.  (The parameters depend on type of
printer.)
