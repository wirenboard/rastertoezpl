Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
================

Process of compilation and installation of Godex printer filter in Ubuntu
14.04 LTS, step by step. On other distributions of Linux the process are
similar.

Lines begin with sign dollar ('$') mean command for shell (Terminal). Copy text
after dollar sign and paste it to Terminal and confirm with Enter.

 1. Prepare system:
    execute application "Terminal" for writing commands
     - run: Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
  
    install utilities for compilation (C compiler and make; gcc and make
    packages)
     - in terminal write:
        $ sudo apt-get install gcc make
  
    install header files of CUPS library (install libcupsimage2-dev package)
     - in terminal write:
        $ sudo apt-get install libcupsimage2-dev
  
    On some systems PPD compiler isn't in default installation.  If you want
    rebuild PPD files and PPD compiler isn't installed, you must install it:
        $ sudo apt-get install cups-ppdc
  
    deactive AppArmor for print server (CUPS) (this is only for test!):
        $ sudo aa-complain /usr/sbin/cupsd
    For the final solution edit /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.cupsd and add line with
    path to rastertoezpl filter with correct rights. More information about
    AppArmor are in FAQ file.

 2. Get and extract the filter source ( - we expect that you download file 
    "rastertoezpl-x.x.tar.gz" from our ftp.  Of course, You can copy this file 
    to Places -> home folder -> src from another source - for example from a 
    USB flash drive.)

    Download archive:
        $ cd src
        $ wget http://path/to/last/version/of/rastertoezpl-x.x.tar.gz
    Extract archive:
        $ tar xzf rastertoezpl-x.x.tar.gz

 3. Compile the filter
    Run configuration of the building and build the filter:
        $ cd rastertoezpl-x.x
        $ ./configure
        $ make

 4. Install the filter and the PPD files to system:
        $ sudo make install

 5. Set Godex printer in system:
    - run: System -> Administration -> Printing
    - icon New: if printer is connected to USB port you would see GODEX printer name, 
      if not choose correct port.
    - Choose filter: choose producer Godex, the correct model and other settings.


Details for installation paths, parameters and other informations are in file
doc/README in the filter archive. After installation this file is loaded in
system (typical /usr/local/share/doc/rastertoezpl/README).
