Rastertoezpl - filter for CUPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This package contain filter (rastertoezpl) and PostScript Printer Description
files (PPD) for Godex thermotransfer label printers for CUPS.

This filter allow set this items on the printer:
  - Media Size
  - Type of media: (see text under list)
    - plain paper
    - labels with gap
    - black mark on back
  - Darkness
  - After Print
    - Nothing (Rewind)
    - Stripper
    - Applicator (for printer with an applicator)
    - Cut page (for printer with a cutter)
    - Cut set (for printer with a cutter)
  - Mirror
  - Negative
  - Rotate 180deg 
  - Print mode
    - Thermal Transfer
    - Direct Thermal
  - Print speed
  - Resolution
  - Stop Position setting
  - Top margin
  - Left margin

Type of media: If item "Black Mark Length" is set to "No Black Mark", then
type of media is set by item "Label Gap Length" and item "Black Mark Position"
is ignored.  If item "Black Mark Length" is set to some length, then type of
media is set to black mark.  Item "Black Mark Position" set distance between
start of label and start of a black mark, "Label Gap Length" is ignored.

Rastertoezpl source code is based on source code of CUPS filter.

It is necessary to install CUPS system for process the filter.  Also is needed
to have available additional CUPS DDK including header files and basic
utilities for compilation, build and install (C compiler, make, install, ...)
this package.  The CUPS Driver Development Kit (DDK) is packed with CUPS 1.4
and higher version.  For CUPS 1.2.x and 1.3.x download and install the DDK
separately.

If you install CUPS from any package system, CUPS is probably distributed in
more packages.  There are some packages necessary to build filter that are not
installed automatically.  They contain the development files for CUPS and
libraries for raster printers "libcupsimage".


After print action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After printing is able to select only one action. The action "Nothing" (Rewind)
is rewinding (send printer command ^D0 and ^O0). The action "Stripper" enable
stripper (^D0 and ^O1). The action "Applicator" activates applicator (^D0 and
^O2). The action "Cut page" activates cutter for every label (page) (^D1 and
^O0). And the action "Cut set" activates cutter for every set of label (page)
copies (^Dx and ^O0; where x is number of copies). For details, see EZPL
Programmerâ€™s Manual.

There are two ways of cutter behavior:
  "cut page" -- cuts after every label,
  "cut set"  -- cuts after every X label, where X is number of copies
                entered to driver, when Collate is not active. When Collate
                is active, it cuts after every label.

There is a problem with setting the cutter in mode "cut set", some applications
don't set number of copies. (These applications don't send one page with
number of copies but send several identical pages. The
same situation is, when Collate is active.) For example, OpenOffice.org Writer
doesn't set number of copies. Evince (GNOME document viewer) sets it.

Other problem is with cutting after whole print task, because CUPS don't give
number of pages to filter, but only number of copies. In fact, the number of
pages is known *only after* printing the whole task.

Of course, for use stripper, applicator or cutter action is needed the matching
hardware.


Configuration - customize PPD files
===================================
Link to rastertoezpl filter and all values of items to set up are saved in PPD
files.

PPD files for Godex printers are generated from source file ppds/godex.drv.
Initial values for most items are available in configuration of printer in
CUPS. Some items have range of values restricted by selection from list.  These
items are: size of label, stop position, top margin, left margin, position and
length of black mark.

If you need any value of item that is not available in selection, you have to
change the list of values.  You can change this list directly in installed file
for the appropriate printer in /etc/cups/ppd (only for expert; file is without
notes, the syntax is strict, some values of item are on more places and it is
necessary to respond!) or in the source file ppds/godex.drv.

In source file we find the list of values that we want to change.  If range of
value of item is limited by printer, this limit is in a note above value of
item.  If we want to add a value to list, we find similar value and copy it and
edit the title (first parameter after "Choice") and a value (second parameter).

All label sizes usable in PPD files are defined on one place with formula
"#media ...".  This defined name of label size that is used with formula
"MediaSize ...", every name of label size is used only once, although is used in
more printers.

If you want to add a label size, first you have to define label size (#media),
and then you have to use it (MediaSize).

After you make above described changes, clean and build PPD files:
 $ make clean-ppd
 $ make build-ppd
, and reinstall PPD files only:
 # make install-data-local

After installation the changed files will be available for CUPS.  It is
necessary to reinstall PPD (Modify printer) in installed printer for use the
changed PPD file.


Installation
============

Description of directories structure in package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
src/ -- sources for filter
ppds/ -- sources for PPD
ppds/ppd/ -- PPD files for Godex printers

Building
~~~~~~~~
Compilation and installation of filter and PPD are typical.  After extracting
archive execute:
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install

PPD files are distributed in the final format.  For rebuilding see section
Configuration.

Installation directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation directories are generated by script "./configure".  Default they
are:
 /usr/lib/cups/filter/ -- (from cups-config) for symbolic link to filter
 /usr/local/libexec/rastertoezpl/ -- for filter rastertoezpl
 /usr/local/doc/rastertoezpl/ -- for documentation
 /usr/local/share/ppd/godex -- for PPD files

You can set another prefix (default is /usr/local/) with command:
 $ ./configure --prefix=/you/location/

You can set another install directory for PPD files with command:
 $ ./configure PPDDIR=/you/PPD/location/

You can create a symbolic link from system PPD directory to installed PPD
directory, if you define variable CREATE_PPDLINK or PPDLINK.  If you define
CREATE_PPDLINK=1, then script ./configure searches for system PPD directory.
Variable PPDLINK define the system PPD directory.  Example:
 $ ./configure CREATE_PPDLINK=1
or
 $ ./configure PPDLINK=/usr/share/ppd

On Mac OS X is always searched system path for PPD and there are also created
symbolic links to installed PPD files (not to the directory!).


Add a Godex printer to CUPS
===========================
After the compilation and installation of filter and PPD files, you can add a
new printer to CUPS.  The default administration of CUPS is on
http://localhost:631.

Some systems for CUPS administration do not use only http://localhost:631, but
another software as well.

For network connection use AppSocket / HP JetDirect, don't use LPD/LPR (it
doesn't work correctly on Godex printers) or IPP (it isn't supported by Godex
printers).


Special settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Godex printers finish communication with computer when label is printed with
delay about 5 seconds.  Same distribution of CUPS expects that printers will
close the communication. There are delays between printed labels in these
cases.  (This is on Mac OS X, for example.)

For network communication with printer, use parameter "waiteof=false" (for
example: DeviceURI socket://192.168.1.179/?waiteof=false).  For details see
http://cups.org/documentation.php/network.html.  For setting this parameter,
stop CUPS daemon, edit /etc/cups/priters.conf file and start CUPS daemon.
On Max OS X, run Terminal:
 $ sudo launchctl stop org.cups.cupsd
 $ sudo nano /etc/cups/printers.conf
 $ sudo launchctl start org.cups.cupsd

CUPS has usb-quirks files for modify USB communication. The files are in CUPS
1.6.4 and newer in directory /usr/share/cups/usb. For Godex printers you can
use parameter "unidir", and if you don't need lp device, you can append
"no-reattach" parameter too.
